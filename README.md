# Code test

## Problem
Write a program that takes one argument, reads the file name without the extension, and count the number of times the name of the file appears in the file content.

## Solution
The solution is implemented in F# and in C#.
To run the program, you need to have the .NET Core SDK installed on your machine.
Just run
```sh
dotnet run <filename>
```
